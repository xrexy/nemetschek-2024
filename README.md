### Required Information

* Name: Radoslav Kolev
* Email: rkolev@proton.me

## Project Structure

The project is setup as a simple monorepo(using pnpm workspaces). It consists of 2 packages:
* lib/ - Contains the implementation of all the homeworks.
* web/ - Not relevant for the homeworks, used only for visualization purposes. It is hosted on https://nemetschek.rakolev.dev

### Why this structure?

It is structured this way, to separate the Web from the homework and 
give the reviewer(s) an easier time to review the homeworks.
